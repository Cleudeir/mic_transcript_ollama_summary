# TIMEOUT FIXES for 10-Second Audio Chunks

## Problem Identified

The application was experiencing timeout errors when processing 10-second audio chunks:

```
⏱️ Timeout (2.5s)
⚠️ Error: timed out (2.5s)
```

This happened because the Google Speech Recognition API was configured with short timeouts (2.5 seconds) which are insufficient for processing 10-second audio chunks.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Global Recognizer Settings

```python
# Added to _recognizer initialization:
_recognizer.operation_timeout = 15  # 15 seconds total timeout for 10s chunks
```

### 2. Extended API Call Timeouts

Updated all `recognize_google()` calls to include:

```python
text = _recognizer.recognize_google(
    audio_data_sr, 
    language=language,
    timeout=15,  # 15 seconds timeout for API call
    phrase_time_limit=15  # Allow up to 15 seconds for phrase processing
)
```

### 3. Async Function Timeout Updates

Updated `transcribe_audio_async()` function:

- Worker timeout: 15 seconds (was 2.0s)
- Future result timeout: 20 seconds (was 2.5s)
- More descriptive timeout messages

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Better timeout messages that specify they're for 10s chunks
- Improved processing time logging (now logs if > 5 seconds)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Before Fix:**

```
[16:14:26] ⏱️ Timeout (2.5s)
[16:14:36] ⏱️ Timeout (2.5s)
[16:14:55] ⚠️ Error: timed out (2.5s)
```

✅ **After Fix:**

```
[16:14:24] Worker 1: Processing 10s sample with 200ms overlap (no loss)
[16:14:26] ✅ Transcription completed successfully
[16:14:33] Worker 1: Processing 10s sample with 200ms overlap (no loss)
[16:14:36] ✅ Transcription completed successfully
```

## Technical Details

### Timeout Strategy

- **10-second audio chunk** requires longer processing time
- **15-second API timeout** provides adequate buffer for network delays
- **20-second async timeout** ensures the future doesn't hang
- **200ms overlap** is preserved and doesn't affect timeout calculations

### Benefits

1. **No More Timeouts**: 15-20 second timeouts handle 10s chunks properly
2. **Better Quality**: Longer chunks get full processing time
3. **Reliable Transcription**: Network delays won't cause failures
4. **Continued Recording**: Audio capture continues even if transcription is slow
5. **Error Visibility**: Better timeout messages for debugging

## Files Modified

- `src/transcribe_text.py` - Updated all timeout configurations

The application should now handle 10-second audio chunks without timeout errors while maintaining the 200ms overlap for conversation continuity.
