# AUDIO CHUNK DURATION CHANGED: 10 SECONDS → 1 SECOND

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully updated the application to use 1-second audio chunks instead of 10-second chunks for faster, more responsive transcription.

## 🔧 **Changes Applied:**

### 1. **Audio Capture (capture_audio.py)**

- Changed default `chunk_duration` from 10 to 1 second
- Updated function documentation and comments
- Maintained 200ms overlap for conversation continuity

### 2. **Transcription Service (transcribe_text.py)**

- Reduced operation timeout from 15 to 5 seconds (appropriate for 1s chunks)
- Updated async timeout from 20 to 8 seconds
- Changed logging threshold from 5s to 2s for slow transcription detection
- Updated all comments to reference 1-second chunks

### 3. **GUI Interface (gui.py)**

- Updated status messages to show "1s samples"
- Changed log messages to reflect 1-second processing
- Updated worker thread messages
- Modified recording completion messages

## 🎯 **New Behavior:**

**Before (10-second chunks):**

```
🎤 Starting continuous audio capture with 10s samples + 200ms overlap
Worker 1: Processing 10s sample with 200ms overlap (no loss)
Recording: 10s samples with 200ms overlap - no conversation lost
```

**After (1-second chunks):**

```
🎤 Starting continuous audio capture with 1s samples + 200ms overlap
Worker 1: Processing 1s sample with 200ms overlap (no loss)
Recording: 1s samples with 200ms overlap - no conversation lost
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of 1-Second Chunks:**

### ✅ **Faster Response:**

- Transcription results appear every ~1 second instead of every ~10 seconds
- Much more real-time experience
- Faster feedback for users

### ✅ **Better Interactivity:**

- Quicker detection of speech start/stop
- More responsive to conversation flow
- Better for interactive scenarios

### ✅ **Reduced Latency:**

- Lower processing delay
- Faster timeout detection
- Quicker error recovery

### ✅ **Maintained Quality:**

- 200ms overlap still preserved (no conversation loss)
- Continuous audio capture unchanged
- Same parallel processing architecture

## ⚖️ **Trade-offs:**

### Potential Considerations

- **More API Calls:** 10x more Google Speech API requests (1 per second vs 1 per 10 seconds)
- **Network Usage:** Higher frequency of API calls
- **Short Speech:** Very brief utterances might be better captured in longer chunks

### Mitigations

- Silence detection still skips empty chunks
- 200ms overlap ensures continuity
- Timeout reduced to match shorter audio length

## 🔄 **Audio Timeline Comparison:**

**Before (10s chunks):**

```
[────10s────][────10s────][────10s────]
          ↑200ms    ↑200ms
```

**After (1s chunks):**

```
[1s][1s][1s][1s][1s][1s][1s][1s][1s][1s]
  ↑200ms overlap between each chunk
```

## 📁 **Files Modified:**

- `src/capture_audio.py` - Changed default chunk duration to 1 second
- `src/transcribe_text.py` - Reduced timeouts and updated comments
- `src/gui.py` - Updated all status messages and log entries

## ✅ **Result:**

The application now provides much faster, more responsive transcription with 1-second audio chunks while maintaining the 200ms overlap to ensure no conversation is ever lost!
