## Language Selection Cleanup Summary

I have successfully removed the language selection components from other tabs and consolidated them into the dedicated "Language Settings" tab. Here's what was changed:

### Changes Made

1. **Removed language selection from Transcript Files tab:**
   - Removed the language frame, label, combobox, and current language display
   - Cleaned up the `create_transcript_files_tab()` method

2. **Removed language selection from ATA Files tab:**
   - Removed the language frame, label, combobox, and current language display
   - Cleaned up the `create_ata_files_tab()` method

3. **Cleaned up old event handlers:**
   - Removed the obsolete `on_language_change()` method that referenced the old `self.language_var`
   - Removed references to `current_lang_label` that no longer exist

4. **Kept the dedicated Language Settings tab:**
   - The dedicated "üåê Language Settings" tab remains intact with proper functionality
   - Uses `self.selected_language_var` and dedicated methods like `apply_language_change()`

### Current State

- **Language selection is now ONLY available in the dedicated "Language Settings" tab**
- **All other tabs (Transcript Files, ATA Files, etc.) are clean and focused on their specific functions**
- **The application runs without errors and maintains all translation functionality**

### Benefits

1. **Better organization:** Language settings are in a dedicated location
2. **Cleaner interface:** Other tabs are not cluttered with language selection
3. **Easier maintenance:** All language-related code is centralized
4. **Better user experience:** Users know exactly where to go to change language settings

The application is now properly organized with language selection only in the dedicated tab as requested.
