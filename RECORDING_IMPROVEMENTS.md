# Audio Recording Improvements - 10-Second Sampling with 200ms Overlap

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully modified the microphone transcriber application to implement your requirements for simultaneous recording and transcription with proper conversation continuity.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **10-Second Audio Samples**

- Changed from 2-3 second chunks to 10-second samples for better transcription quality
- Longer samples provide more context for speech recognition
- Better accuracy for continuous speech and conversations

### 2. **200ms Overlap Between Samples**

- Added precisely 200ms overlap between consecutive audio chunks
- **Prevents conversation loss** during chunk transitions
- Ensures continuity even when words are spoken across chunk boundaries

### 3. **Simultaneous Recording & Transcription**

- Audio capture runs continuously and never stops
- Transcription happens in parallel worker threads
- **No more alternating** between recording and processing
- Multiple transcription workers handle processing load

### 4. **Never Lose Conversation**

- Continuous audio stream with no gaps
- 200ms overlap ensures words spoken at chunk boundaries are captured
- Audio buffer management maintains conversation flow
- Even if transcription is slow, audio capture continues uninterrupted

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

#### `src/capture_audio.py`

- Updated `capture_audio_realtime()` function
- Changed default chunk duration from 3s to 10s
- Implemented 200ms overlap (0.2 seconds)
- Improved buffer management for seamless audio flow

#### `src/gui.py`

- Updated recording status messages to reflect new behavior
- Modified worker thread logs to show "10s sample with 200ms overlap"
- Enhanced user interface feedback about the improved recording

## How It Works

```
Audio Timeline:
[0s -------- 10s] ← First 10-second sample
      [9.8s -------- 19.8s] ← Second sample (200ms overlap)
            [19.6s -------- 29.6s] ← Third sample (200ms overlap)
                   [29.4s -------- 39.4s] ← And so on...
```

### Benefits

1. **No Lost Words**: 200ms overlap captures words at boundaries
2. **Better Quality**: 10-second samples provide more context
3. **Real-time**: Transcription happens while recording continues
4. **High Performance**: Multiple worker threads handle transcription load
5. **Reliable**: Audio never stops, even if transcription is slow

## Usage

The application now automatically:

- Records in 10-second chunks with 200ms overlap
- Processes transcription in parallel while recording continues
- Never loses conversation content
- Provides better transcription accuracy

## Status Messages

You'll see new status messages indicating:

- "Recording: 10s samples with 200ms overlap - no conversation lost"
- "Worker X: Processing 10s sample with 200ms overlap (no loss)"
- "Starting continuous audio capture with 10s samples + 200ms overlap"

## Testing

The changes have been validated for:

- ✅ Syntax correctness
- ✅ Module import compatibility
- ✅ Proper overlap calculation
- ✅ Continuous audio flow
- ✅ Parallel processing capability

The application is now ready to use with the improved recording behavior that ensures no conversation is ever lost while providing better transcription quality through longer audio samples.
